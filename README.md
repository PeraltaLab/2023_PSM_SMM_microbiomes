## We address the following aim:

* **Aim:** This study examines examine how salinity stressors influence plant-microbe relationships, where we hypothesize that the presence of microbes will buffer salinity stressor effects.

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:** An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Ariane Peralta, Kai Davis.

* **bin:** 
	* *MothurTools.R*: An R script written by [Dr. Mario E. Muscarella](Mario.E.Muscarella@gmail.com) [(website)](https://muscarellalab.github.io/) containing functions used in the analysis of community sequence data.

* **data:** Files associated with amplicon data sets, plant biomass and plant height. 

* **figures:** Figures (microbes-16S rRNA amplicon, plant biomass, plant height) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.

* **mothur:** Files containing script for bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Illumina MiSeq platform) using mothur pipeline.
